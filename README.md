sc2-yolo-gears
==============

A python SC2 Replay processor that duplicates the functionality of much better programs

To run simply python2 gui.py. The dependencies for this program are only python2 compatible at the moment, so it must be run this way

For the code to work you must have Tkinter installed (it ships with python?) and also sc2reader available from git here: https://github.com/GraylinKim/sc2reader

just clone and install either via pypi or python2 setup.py install.

The program will take a significant period of time on startup as it processes all the replays. THis can be shortened by decreasing the number of replays in the 'replays/' folder
